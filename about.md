Hi, my name is __Aziz Khambati__ and I am a __Web Developer__ with equal parts interest in front-end, back-end, and everything there is to it.

I study at Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani which is located in Pilani a remote part of Rajasthan, India.

I am originally from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India while my hometome is Khambhat (hence the surname).

I have developed websites for my college's technical and cultural festival primarily in Adobe Flash. I've developed & conducted online events as a part of our technical festival Apogee.

I absolutely love Adobe Flash and hate myself in having to shift to Javascript due to decreasing/increasing popularity of the two. I belive there can never be anything remotely close to Flash and the advances it has made.

I am currently interning at FiberLink as a Software Developer Intern and am loving it.
