sticky menu including navigation thingy

Smint is a simple jQuery plugin for lovers of one page websites that helps with the navigation on one page style websites.

It has 2 main elements, a sticky navigation bar that stays at the top of the page while you scroll down and menu buttons that automatically scroll the page to the section you clicked on.

It is developed by Robert McCracken (@rabmyself), Ryan Clarke (@clarkieryan) and mcpacosy (@mcpacosy). You can check out Robert's website [here](http://www.outyear.co.uk/smint/).

I wanted to develop a website like this for a project, so I've made my own modifications like reducing the number of times a particular segment of code ran and other issues.
