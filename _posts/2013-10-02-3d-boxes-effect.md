I made this litebox effect. (Not so sure about the terminology, maybe if someone can help me with the keywords.) [Here](http://www.bits-oasis.org/2011/webp/) is a link to the website where it was used.

##ActionScript 3.0

##Javascript

I have ported it to Javascript as well using Three.js and [GreenSock Animation Platform](http://www.greensock.com/gsap-js/)

I wanted to work on this, making it more generic and easy to use. But now I think I might never get the time to do so. Hopefully the code is easy to understand, I can help if someone wishes to use it in their project.
