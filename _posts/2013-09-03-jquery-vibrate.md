jQuery Vibrate Plugin is a jQuery component, self-contained, that allows you to have "vibrating" tags in your page, like buttons, DIVs, etc. It is very simple to use and integrate, and lightweight (only 3.54 kB in minified version)!

It was developed by [albertoarena](https://github.com/albertoarena). You can see his version [here](https://github.com/albertoarena/jquery-vibrate) and his demo site [here](http://www.dev4web.eu/projects/jquery.vibrate/).

I modified it to add the Vibrate for a fixed Period and a callback function when the vibration gets over. It is my very first jQuery Plugin and my very first fork on github. â˜º I used it in my game [Tic Tac Toe Square](http://ttt2-termvader.rhcloud.com/) when notifying users about incorrect move.

##Demo
