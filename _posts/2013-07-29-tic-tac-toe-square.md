Here's the link: [http://termvader.github.io/TTTSquare/](http://termvader.github.io/TTTSquare/)

Being inspired from a senior's post on [http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/](http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/), I thought of developing an online two player version of the same.

So here's an update: I finished with a two player same computer version, you can find it over [here](http://termvader.github.io/TTTSquare/)

Am writing the server side part in Node.js and hosting on heroku. Hoping to finish it soon.
