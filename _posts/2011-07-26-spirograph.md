Check out the source of this website, repositories and other files.

So finally I think I am close to a completion at modifying the design of this site. I have two repositories related to it. One is the jekyll source which is [https://github.com/termvader/azizhk-blog-source](https://github.com/termvader/azizhk-blog-source). Basically I am using plugins to generate pages related to the tags and categories, hence I cannot directly upload on azizhk.github.io repo, which btw is [https://github.com/azizhk/azizhk.github.io](https://github.com/azizhk/azizhk.github.io).

This website is inspired and sort of modified from David Ensinger's website which can be found here: [http://davidensinger.com/](http://davidensinger.com/) and the github repo for the source is available over here: [https://github.com/davidensinger/davidensinger.github.io](https://github.com/davidensinger/davidensinger.github.io)

I have made some few changes from David's source,
- Made different files for categories and tags pages to seperate stuff.
- Added a Build.bat file to build from Windows. (If you are using Mac or Linux, you can check out David's Rake file and his awesome post explaining it [here](http://davidensinger.com/2013/07/automating-jekyll-deployment-to-github-pages-with-rake/))

If you are developing your own site by forking from mine, please change the logo.

And finally, to all my department mates,
